# hdc-quantum
Overview
This Python script simulates quantum teleportation using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) and a photonic LCD system. The simulation incorporates quantum error correction (QEC) techniques, specifically the 3-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip codes, to enhance the robustness of the teleportation process. The fidelity of teleportation is analyzed under varying conditions, including entanglement weights, measurement bases, and noise models.

The script demonstrates how HDC and optical systems can be combined to simulate quantum teleportation, offering a scalable and energy-efficient platform for quantum-inspired computing.

Key Features
Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC):

Uses high-dimensional vectors (hypervectors) to represent quantum states.

Supports operations such as superposition, binding, and permutation.

Inherently noise-tolerant due to the distributed nature of hypervectors.

Photonic LCD System:

Simulates optical operations such as polarization control, phase shifting, and entanglement.

Provides a parallel computing platform for simulating quantum teleportation.

Quantum Error Correction (QEC):

Implements 3-qubit bit-flip and phase-flip codes for error correction.

Combines both codes into a hybrid error correction approach for enhanced robustness.

Noise Models:

Supports depolarizing noise and amplitude damping noise to simulate realistic quantum environments.

Allows testing of teleportation fidelity under different noise conditions.

Teleportation Simulation:

Simulates the teleportation of a quantum state encoded as a hypervector.

Measures fidelity between the original and teleported states under various conditions.

Code Structure
The script is organized into several key functions:

1. Hypervector Initialization
initialize_hypervector(dim): Initializes a random hypervector of a given dimension and normalizes it.

2. Entanglement
entangle_hypervectors_weighted(vec1, vec2, weight1, weight2): Combines two hypervectors using a weighted sum to simulate entanglement.

3. Measurement
measure_hypervector(state, basis): Simulates measurement by projecting the state onto a basis.

4. Permutation
permute_hypervector(vector, permutation): Applies a permutation to a hypervector.

5. Similarity Calculation
calculate_similarity(vec1, vec2): Calculates the similarity (fidelity) between two hypervectors.

6. Photonic LCD System

7. Quantum Error Correction
Bit-Flip Code:

encode_bit_flip_code(state): Encodes a hypervector using the 3-qubit bit-flip code.

decode_bit_flip_code(encoded_state): Decodes a hypervector using majority voting.

Phase-Flip Code:

encode_phase_flip_code(state): Encodes a hypervector using the 3-qubit phase-flip code.

decode_phase_flip_code(encoded_state): Decodes a hypervector using majority voting.

Hybrid Error Correction:

encode_hybrid_code(state): Combines bit-flip and phase-flip codes for encoding.

decode_hybrid_code(encoded_state): Decodes a hypervector using the hybrid code.

8. Noise Models
apply_depolarizing_noise(state, error_prob): Applies depolarizing noise to a hypervector.

apply_amplitude_damping(state, damping_factor): Applies amplitude damping noise to a hypervector.
